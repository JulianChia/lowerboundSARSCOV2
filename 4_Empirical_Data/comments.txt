COVID19_Confirmed_Cases_Info_till_2020_05_27.csv
- It contains infomation of each COVID-19 case in Singapore that my son, Samuel, & I could extract daily from 
  Singapore's Minitry of Health(MOH) - UPDATES ON SINGAPORE'S COVID-19 SITUATION daily reports
  https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 (and its Daily COVID-19 Case Portal which was obsoleted by MOH in 2020).  

COVID19_epidemic_trends.csv
- Singapore's Imported and Local COVID-19 epidemic trends from 23rd Jan 2020 to 18th Aug 2020.
- Extracted from SG's MOH Situation Report. https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/testing/situation-report-pdf

Remarks:
- When compiling these data daily in 2020, a few minor discrepancies were noticed. There seemed to be a few 
  revisions/updates made on the COVID-19 confirmed case info post COVID-19 confirmation (e.g. in their 
  classification as local or imported cases). Some of these changes are not reflected in the above data
  files when explanation were not found. Therefore, please note that the data in the abovementioned files
  were collected in 2020 with best of intention and is not an exact duplicate of SG MOH latest published data.
- According to https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/local-situation-report/20200818_daily_report_on_covid-19.pdf,
  on 18th Aug 2020 the Total, Imported and Local populations are 55938, 814 and 55124. 
  In COVID19_epidemic_trends.csv, the Total, Imported and Local populations are 55937, 801 and 55136.
  These minor discrepancies are expected to have negligible influence on the conclusion of this paper/thesis.
